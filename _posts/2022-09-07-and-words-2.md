Gurudev pranam . Gurudev saranam.

Shri Govinda Gaanii Saranam. Pranam.

  
 

 

Aim of your incarnation in this beautiful mother earth is to live a God graced life of material enrichment and spiritual enlightenment. The AUM,

*Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the universe and the English is the language of the earth, of our mankind. Prepare your self to achieve the excellence and contribute your time and money and knowledge comfortably. Learn it and help your near and dear ones to learn it to speak fluently, to write creatively and to remember in the magic way like music/song and picture/painting, using your five senses i.e eye, ear, taste, touch and smell to remember, remind, and reproduce easily. What I gained in my 20 years you can in 02 years for the grace of God and bless of my beloved Gurudev. Empower yourself in the English and excel the fragrance, beauty, and colour. Do your best for your family and friends and we will do the rest for our beloved world for the unification of the mankind and mother land India into United States Of India (U.S.I) like U.S.A. Pranam.*

 
__Vedic English method__ : Use your five senses to remember. You may not know which sense is powerful and which is less. Take help of all. 100 beautiful and sweet words can make you an expert, unbelievable but true.
 
__Eye__ : beautiful colour like painting, for aesthetic looking, sweet sense pleasing. Praise it, oh what a beautiful word ; ah beautiful colour.
